# Data Analytics Project'24: E-commerce Sales Analysis for Unicorn

# Project Overview
This project served as a foundational step in applying key data analytics techniques to real-world business scenarios. The project aimed to integrate concepts from SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize e-commerce sales data for Unicorn, a growing online marketplace. The goal was to uncover actionable insights that would guide business decisions and help identify areas for growth.

# Project Background
Unicorn is a family-owned e-commerce platform that has been steadily gaining market share over the past two decades. The platform offers a variety of products, ranging from books and clothes to household items. The company's stakeholders are highly invested in its growth and have a small analytics team. They are seeking to expand their data analytics capabilities and have provided a sample dataset spanning the years 2015-2018 to help guide their business strategies.

# Key Project Tasks
The project was divided into four main parts:

## Data Exploration with SQL:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to understand the structure of the sales data, identify patterns, and retrieve key metrics.

## Data Cleaning Using Spreadsheets:
Cleaned and prepared the data by addressing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset was ready for in-depth analysis.

## Insight Generation Using Tableau:
Visualized the cleaned data using Tableau to identify trends, outliers, and key performance indicators that could inform business decisions.

## Executive Summary and Presentation:
Compiled findings into an executive summary and prepared a presentation to communicate insights to stakeholders in a clear and actionable manner.

# Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:
- To apply analytical tools to a real-world e-commerce dataset.
- To derive meaningful insights from the data to help Unicorn make data-driven decisions.
- To identify potential weak areas and business opportunities for Unicorn to improve its performance.

This project served as an opportunity to showcase skills in SQL, data cleaning, and visualization, while also developing a deeper understanding of how data analytics can drive business growth in the competitive e-commerce sector.







# Final Report: Sales and Profitability Optimization: A Strategic Analysis of 2018 Performance

## Introduction and Objective
In today’s competitive landscape, maximizing profitability requires a strategic approach to sales optimization. This report examines key drivers of financial performance for 2018 across product categories, regions, and customer segments, with a focus on understanding the discrepancies between sales volume and profitability. Our goal is to identify actionable insights that will enable sustainable growth while preserving profit margins.

## Key Findings
i. Product Category Performance
Technology stands out as the leading product category, achieving both high sales ($305.3K) and significant profit ($56.9K), indicating strong demand and healthy margins. In contrast, Office Supplies, while stable in sales, yields lower profit margins, likely due to competitive pricing pressures. Furniture, despite strong sales contributions, suffers from low profitability due to heavy discounting practices. This reveals a critical challenge in maintaining competitive pricing without eroding margins.

ii. Regional Performance Analysis
The East region emerges as the top contributor, leading in both sales and profit, which reflects strong market penetration and customer demand. The West region, while achieving strong sales, shows lower profit margins, suggesting potential areas for operational cost improvements. The South, although contributing the least in sales, maintains high profit margins, possibly due to efficient operations or favorable pricing. The Central region, with moderate performance across both sales and profit, shows potential for targeted growth efforts.

iii. Customer Segment Insights
In terms of customer segments, Consumers generate the highest sales ($327.8K) but lower profit margins due to frequent discounting. Corporate customers contribute stable revenue with a balanced profit, while the Home Office segment, though smallest in sales, achieves the highest profitability, underscoring the benefits of minimized discounting and effective cost management within this group.

iv. Strategic Recommendations
To address these findings and optimize financial outcomes, the following strategies are recommended:
- Regional Focus: Concentrate marketing efforts on high-performing regions like the East and West, while leveraging successful practices to boost profitability in the Central region.
- Discount Strategy: Reassess discounting policies, particularly in the Furniture category, to preserve profit margins.
- Customer Segment Profitability: Improve the profitability of the Consumer segment by balancing discounting strategies with margin targets.
- Operational Efficiency: Enhance shipping and cost efficiencies across all regions to support profitability goals.
